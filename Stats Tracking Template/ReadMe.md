<h2> Basketball Stats Tracking Template </h2>
This is a template that allows custom stats tracking with an emphasis on play calling and team execution. The form can be altered for different metrics and to track defensive variables. 
<br>
<br>
General customization for you team:
1) Download the folder
2) Adjust the list of player numbers in the position and player variables starting on line 40 of the index.html file
3) Enter custom play calls starting on line 170
4) Save to start tracking statitics, and export csv file to analyze

<br>
Eventually I will publish some scripts to the repo as analysis examples
<br>
