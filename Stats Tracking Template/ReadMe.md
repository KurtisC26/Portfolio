<h2> Basketball Stats Tracking Template </h2>
This is a template that allows custom stats tracking with an emphasis on play calling and team execution. The template can be modified for custom play calls, different offensive variables or even defensive stats with some adjustments. The form can be connected to a database, and be used as a local file or be published.
